# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier | Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **decision tree classifier** built to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to identify key factors that influence customer behavior and predict subscription likelihood.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **Prodigy_DS_03_Decision_Tree_Classifier.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation of the decision tree classifier.
- **data/**: Folder containing the Bank Marketing dataset.
- **prodigy_DS_03__Decision_Tree_Classifier.pdf**: PDF report summarizing the findings and performance of the model.

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Prediction Target**: The model predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
2. **Top Predictors**:
   - **Previous Contact**: Customers previously contacted are more likely to subscribe.
   - **Age**: Middle-aged customers (30-45) are more likely to subscribe.
   - **Job Type**: Certain job sectors show a higher likelihood of subscription.
3. **Model Performance**: The decision tree classifier achieved an **accuracy of 89.5%**.
